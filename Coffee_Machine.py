                  It should not continue to make the drink but print: "Sorry there is not enough water."

                     prompt the user to inser coins.
                  b. Remember that quarters = $0.25, dimes= $0.1, nickels = $0.05, and pennies = $0.01.
                  c. Calculate the monetary value of the coins inserted. E.g. 1 quarter, 2 dimes, 1 nickel, 2 pennies = 0.25 + 0.1 * 2 + 0.05 * 0.01 *2 = $0.52'''

                  a. Check that the user has inserted enough money to purchase the drink they selected.
                     E.g. Latte cost $2.50, but they only inserted $0.52 then after counting the coins the
                     program should say "Sorry that's not enough money. Money refunded."
                  b. But if the user has inserted enough money, then the cost of the drinkg gets added to the machine 
                     as the profit and this will be reflected in the next time "report" is triggered. E.g. 
                     Water: 100ml
                     Milk: 50ml
                     Coffee: 76g
                     Money: $2.52
                  c. If the user has inserted too much oney, the machine should offer change.
                     E.g. "Here is $2.45 dollars in change." The change should be rounded to 2 decimal places.'''
